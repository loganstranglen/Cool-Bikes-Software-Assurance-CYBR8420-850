This week's project deliverable offered a unique challenge requiring new team-based strategies. Due to our OSS project's process overlap, the team had to separate into pairs (Ryan-Perry, Logan-Daniel, Cole-et al.) to create high-level data flow diagrams that accurately demonstrate how Cardea works. As a result, additional sidebar meetings between each team pair were established outside our standard weekly team meeting, requiring more time management and organization. Furthermore, this week's deliverable required using a new application, Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool (TMT), which presented its unique challenges. A few team members experienced device compatibility issues with TMT that required workarounds (Perry using MacOS - leveraged virtual machines, and worked with Ryan to complete the data flow diagram & Logan: bad TMT installation, which prohibited him from conducting the threat modeling feature - worked with Daniel to complete data flow diagram). Outside of these minor issues, The Cool Bikes Software Assurance team did an excellent job completing this week's project deliverable. Our team has improved with organization and communication over the past few weeks and scheduling more time to meet and complete project-related tasks. By leveraging our team's increased efficiency, we could work around any challenges this deliverable presented and complete the deliverable in record time (avoiding last-minute work). One area of focus moving forward is to utilize the project section even more by adding more minor project milestones per team member so tasks are more transparent. Additionally, as stated in the previous deliverable, our group will maintain our three meeting times of 6:30 pm on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Overall, we are pleased with this deliverable and enjoyed learning more about our OSS project and using a new tool in TMT. We are looking forward to completing the next deliverable.
